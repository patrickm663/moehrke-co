This repo is a proof-of-concept to test deployment using a Docker Container running Nginx on a Debian AWS EC2 instance, through my own DNS. 

The deployment worked as expected, but however this project has been temporarily put in hold until I am able to use a Raspberry Pi as a full-time server solution - with accompanying email server. In addition, the website will be updated to serve as a personal landing page.
