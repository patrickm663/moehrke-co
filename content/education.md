Below is a summary of my tertiary education, ASSA exams, and certifications achieved to date:
## Education
### BCom Hons Actuarial Science
##### _2020_ | Stellenbosch University, Western Cape, ZA
#### Honours Research Project: _Evaluating the use of genetics to calculate risk premiums with applications to Huntingtonâ€™s Disease_

This project was very interesting for two reasons:
- The topic exposed me to genetics and how one can construct survival models for genetic deseases
- All of the modelling needed to be performed from first-principles (as there were no available packages) which made me more comfortable with scientific computing and numerical methods 
- It was my first real exposure to LaTeX and taught me how R can interface with LaTeX to produce pretty tables and plots.

### BCom Actuarial Science
##### _2017-2019_ | Stellenbosch University, Western Cape, ZA
#### Majors
Actuarial Science and Mathematical Statistics
