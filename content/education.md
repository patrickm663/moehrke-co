## Education
### Stellenbosch University | BCom Honours Actuarial Science
_2020_

**Honours Research Project** 

_Evaluating the use of genetics to calculate risk premiums with applications to Huntingtonâ€™s Disease_

This project was very interesting for three main reasons:
- The topic exposed me to genetics and how one can construct survival models for genetic diseases
- All of the modelling needed to be performed from first-principles (as there were no available packages) which made me more comfortable with scientific computing and numerical methods 
- It was my first real exposure to LaTeX and taught me how R can interface with LaTeX to produce pretty tables and plots.
