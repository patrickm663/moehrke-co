He is a Technical member of the Actuarial Society of South Africa, having passed 9 of his actuarial exams. Patrick is aiming towards Fellowship qualification.

Patrick has strong experience using R and Python for data science -- both in a consulting capacity and as a tutor. He has experience presenting webinars and training pieces to actuarial professionals and others in the insurance industry through [Actuartech](https://actuartech.com).

Patrick has a passion for development and all things IT. He is a supporter of FOSS that strives to make use of and contribute back to the open source community wherever possible.

In personal projects, he prefers programming in Julia where possible and feels it is ripe for exploration by the actuarial community. Patrick's development setup is relatively minimal, sticking to Oh-my-ZSH for his terminal, Neovim (with a few helpful plugins) for coding and writing, and Jupyter for exploratory data science. For those interested, the Oh-my-ZSH, Neovim, and Jupyter config files are backed up [here](https://github.com/patrickm663/config-files).

As a developer, Patrick is comfortable in Windows and Linux, including managing Linux server administration tasks. Patrick works in a Linux environment where possible, his daily driver being PopOS. He has experience in Docker and Amazon Web Services, and hosts this website using a combination of S3, CodePipelines, and Cloudfront.
