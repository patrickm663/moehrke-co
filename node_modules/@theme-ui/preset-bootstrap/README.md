# [@theme-ui/preset-bootstrap](https://theme-ui.com/presets/bootstrap)

Theme UI includes `@theme-ui/preset-bootstrap` which can be used as an example or
starting point for extending your own themes.

```sh
npm i @theme-ui/preset-bootstrap
```

```jsx
// example theme
import theme from '@theme-ui/preset-bootstrap'

export default {
  ...theme,
  styles: {
    ...theme,
  },
}
```
