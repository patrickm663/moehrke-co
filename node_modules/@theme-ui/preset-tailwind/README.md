# [@theme-ui/preset-tailwind](https://theme-ui.com/presets/tailwind)

Theme UI includes `@theme-ui/preset-tailwind` which can be used as an example or
starting point for extending your own themes.

```sh
npm i @theme-ui/preset-tailwind
```

```jsx
// example theme
import theme from '@theme-ui/preset-tailwind'

export default {
  ...theme,
  // You can extend the default theme like:
  // styles: {
  //   ...theme.styles,
  //}
}
```
