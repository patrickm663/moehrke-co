Honours Research Project
Evaluating the use of genetics to calculate risk premiums with applications to Huntingtonâ€™s Disease
This project was very interesting for three main reasons:
The topic exposed me to genetics and how one can construct survival models for genetic diseases All of the modelling needed to be performed from first-principles (as there were no available packages) which made me more comfortable with scientific computing and numerical methods It was my first real exposure to LaTeX and taught me how R can interface with LaTeX to produce pretty tables and plots.</description></item><item><title>Experience</title><link>/experience/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/experience/</guid><description>Dupro Advisory | Actuarial Consultant Link to heading 2020-Present
