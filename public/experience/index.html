He is a supporter of FOSS that strives to make use of and contribute back to the open source community wherever possible.</p><p>In personal projects, he prefers programming in Julia where possible and feels it is ripe for exploration by the actuarial community. Patrick&rsquo;s development setup is relatively minimal, sticking to Oh-my-ZSH for his terminal, Neovim (with a few helpful plugins) for coding and writing, and Jupyter for exploratory data science. For those interested, the Oh-my-ZSH, Neovim, and Jupyter config files are backed up <a href=https://github.com/patrickm663/config-files>here</a>.</p><p>As a developer, Patrick is comfortable in Windows and Linux, including managing Linux server administration tasks. Patrick works in a Linux environment where possible, his daily driver being PopOS. He has experience in Docker and Amazon Web Services, and hosts this website using a combination of S3, CodePipelines, and Cloudfront.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
